  <h5>What can I say about Motherhood?</h5>
<br>
<p>Motherhood has been one of the most exhausting but yet rewarding journey I have ever embarked on.
I have learnt so much during this short period, looking at the fact my daughter is just a few months old and haven’t reached her prime years as yet.
I have received a lot of support from mothers, friends, relatives and colleagues and it’s a journey that I will be forever learning, because it holds a lot of different challenges that I am yet to experience.
However, I am here to share my experiences and journey that I have faced so far and I truly believe the challenges that I have been through will really help and support newly mums, even though it’s a stage in your life that requires you to always learn and face new challenges.
<br>
<br>
I was very reluctant on sharing my story; battling fears and doubts on whether if I was even doing a great job of being a mum and obviously knowing how much a mother’s care can really impacts a childhood.
I have also researched and asked other mums to also share their experiences, because every mum have a story to share  that can help with ways mine one probably wouldn’t.
<br>
<br>
My motherhood journey started off with me being very sceptical to how I was being seen as a mother and whether or not I projected myself to be a good one.
There’s a saying that said we cannot run away from who we really are and that also comes with motherhood, we know whether or not we’re being a good mother.
We know the moments that we wish we could spend a bit more time in the shower, the hair salon or go on a shopping spree, but in life with everything that we gain also comes along sacrifices, we have to give and take and motherhood is all about that; being selfless and remembering we have someone that is depending on us for everything.
One of most regarding moments of being a mother is knowing that you’re needed, you’re the life support of a beautiful being, that knows you by smell, touch and voice, a being that loves you more than anything else in this world and smiles at you whenever you’re in their sight and cries when you’re not.
<br>
<br>
Let me go to the stage before I was able to hold this beautiful gift from God in my arms, the stage where she was developing in my stomach and my experiences; the stage of being pregnant.
During pregnancy I didn’t face as much struggles as I thought I would, I didn’t really experience morning sickness, but one of the hardest moments I must say was when I lost my brother which was at the beginning of my pregnancy. This stage in my life made me realised that not only will I be facing the challenge of being a new mum but I need to be ready for the challenges that will come from the outside regarding the different areas in my life. This moment is where I had to be strong as a person both for my unborn baby as well as my family and yes it was hard, but I had to learn how to handle it. I was also going through a lot of changes in terms of my body; my sense of smell, I was very sensitive to certain perfumes, which made me feel sick and my sense of taste, I diverted from food that I would previously loved to eat to disliking them.
<br>
<br>
My journeys to work was also very challenging, especially travelling underground which will get really hot at times and the only thing that would cool me down would be a mango and passion fruit smoothie until my body started rejecting it and then I found a new love which was super-malt.</p>
