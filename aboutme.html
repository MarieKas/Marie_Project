      <p style="font size: 40px; ">After graduating in 2009 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree (First Class Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last nine years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as part of a team in various companies across Galway, Dublin, Berlin and Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column" style="background-color: white;">
      <p>I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design. During my Multimedia degree I studied Information Architecture, and therefore have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.</p>
