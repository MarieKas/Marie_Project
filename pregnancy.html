      <h2>Blood pressure during pregnancy</h2>
<br>
      <p>Hello all, my name is Hawa im a registered nurse in the UK with over 4 years experience in clinical and community healthcare. I have covered some experience into womens health and pregancy. One of the most important aspects to be aware about in pregancy is blood pressure. Most women experience high blood pressure during pregnancy and after.
<br>
<br>
        Simple tips in keeping your blood pressure stable during your time of pregnancy are:
        <br>
        <br>
        • Balanced diet - more fruit and vegetables
        <br>
        • exercise - walks, swimming
        <br>
        • Good rest - Have some "Me time" investinh in yourself
        <br>
        • Plenty water - more fluids you take the more you can flush out all the waste in your body, helps you improve blood circulation.
<br>
<br>
        Most improtantly enjoy your journey into motherhood, always seeking advice with your family planning nurse/midwife for any questions or worries you have.

      <h2>Dental care during pregnancy</h2>
<br>
<p>Let me start off by congratulating you on your pregnancy! Pregnancy is one of the most precious, beautiful, and rewarding things which one can experience. For another, this can also be very challenging and very daunting in terms of your oral health. Being able to keep up on top of your oral hygiene plays a vital key part during your pregnancy period.
<br>
<br>
One of the main and most common symptoms of oral health issues is bleeding gums and inflammation of the gums. If you have experienced this, I just want to assure you that this is completely normal however it is vital that you are aware of the steps you need to take in order for you to be in control and on top of it.
<br>
<br>
What are the main causes of bleeding gums?
<br>
<br>
Bleeding gums are caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can make your gums more vulnerable to plaque, leading to inflammation and bleeding this is called pregnancy gingivitis or gum disease.
<br>
<br>
How can you avoid and prevent Gingivitis from getting worse?
<br>
<br>
• Regular visits to the dentist
<br>
• Regular visits to the hygienist
<br>
• Brushing your teeth carefully twice a day for exactly two minutes
<br>
• Using fluoride toothpaste and fluoride mouthwash
<br>
• Use floss and interdental brushes between your teeth to remove small bits of food (this helps to prevent plaque)
<br>
• Use a small-headed toothbrush with soft filaments (bristles)
<br>
• Avoid having sugary drinks (especially fizzy), sugary food +sweets
<br>
• Stop smoking, as this can make gum disease worse
<br>
• A daily salt rinse (1 table spoon of salt added to cup of warm water) can help reduce inflammation. Swirl the wash around your mouth a few times before spitting (DO NOT SWOLLOW)
<br>
<br>
Above all of this please try to maintain a very good balanced diet, making sure that you are having enough fruit and vegetable in order to keep your mouth as healthy as possible. Please do not attempt to use a Peroxyl based mouthwash.
<br>
<br>
In terms of medicines during pregnancy, you mainly want to avoid ibuprofen and aspirin. Paracetamol is fine to take. Amoxicillin and metronidazole are considered safe too.
<br>
<br>
By keeping on top of a balanced diet will result to you have a less chance of developing caries.
<br>
<br>
If you are living in the UK please remember that dental care is completely free for expectant mother, the free service is also valid after you give birth for one year! Please take advantage and make good use of this service!

<h2>Breastfeeding</h2>
<br>
<p>
Many woman have good reasons for not breastfeeding which include: “My breasts will sag, it hurts my breasts, my nipples get too sore, less time to yourself, can’t drink alcohol and breastfeed”. However the benefits outweigh the risks, most problems to do with soreness can be easily fixed with correct attachment.
Using the synonym CHIN is helpful as it helps with positioning your baby during each feed.
C- (Close)keep the baby in close to your body
H- (Head free) don’t hold the babies head in place, let it be free and provide minimum support
I- (in line) keep the baby in a 90 degree angle
N- (Nose to nipple) put the babies nose to the mothers nipple and the baby will gradually move the mouth to find the nipple.
<br>
<br>
Many health benefits come with breastfeeding as it provides
- protection from infections and diseases
- Nutrients needed for the baby to grow
- Reduces baby’s risk of obesity, SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), diarrhoea and cardiovascular disease (in adulthood)
- Prevents Post Partum depression (as the mother bonds more with the baby) and type 2 diabetes
- Reduces Stress and breast Cancer
- Lessens bleeding which is experienced after birth
- Saves money as you don’t need to buy formula milk
<br>
<br>
Many studies say that breastfeeding can help the mother lose weight from 300-500 calories a day.
<br>
<br>
As a student midwife I have seen more woman bottle feed because they give up too easily when they can’t get their baby to latch on. I want to encourage every mother or mother to be to not give up. The satisfying feeling of knowing everything your baby needs is in your breast milk really allows a deeper connection to form between you and your baby.
